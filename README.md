# GitHub-Documentation
This is a documentation on some basic concepts of Git and GitHub that can also be used as a beginners guide.

##What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers manage and track changes in their codebase. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
It is used for:
*Tracking code changes
*Tracking who made changes
*Coding collaboration

##Some terminologies used in git.

###1. Repository (Repo):
---A repository is a folder or storage space where your project resides. It contains all the files, commit history, and configuration information.

###2. Clone:
Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
---This allows you to work on the code locally and contribute changes back to the remote repository.

###3. Commit:
---A commit is a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. It represents a set of changes you have made to your files.
###4. Branch:
---A branch is a separate line of development in a Git repository. Branches allow multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other.

###4. Merge:
---Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch. It is often used to integrate feature branches back into the main branch.
