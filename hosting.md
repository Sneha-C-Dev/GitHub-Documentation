## GITHUB, GitLab And BitBucket

When it comes to version control systems, Git is one of the most popular options out there. It allows developers to collaborate on code and track changes over time. But Git is just the underlying technology - there are several platforms that offer Git hosting and other features to make development workflows more efficient. Three of the most popular Git hosting platforms are Github, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Some of the key features of __Github__ include:
* Code hosting and version control with Git
* Pull requests and code reviews
* Issue tracking and project management
* Integration with other tools like Slack and Jira
* Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) with Github Actions

__GitLab__ also offers more features than Github out of the box. Some of these features include:
* GitLab is another cloud-based service that offers Git hosting and collaboration features. It's similar to Github in many ways, but it has some key differences. For one thing, GitLab is open-source software that can be self-hosted.
* Integrated CI/CD pipelines
* Built-in container registry
* Code quality and security scans
* Group-level access controls
* Wiki and documentation pages
__Bitbucket__ is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian. It provides teams with a platform to collaborate on code, manage repositories, and track changes made to code over time. Bitbucket supports both Git and Mercurial version control systems.
* Code Management
* Pull Requests
* Branching and Merging
* Integrations
* Security
